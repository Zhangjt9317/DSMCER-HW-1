Do the assigned reading for DSM-CER (The Data Science review article by Beck et al.). If you have any lingering questions, enter them in the appropriate cell below, in markdown format and colored in red text.

Find a research paper related to your own research area, or a research area of interest that is at the intersection of materials/chemicals science/engineering and Data Science. In the appropriate cell below, add the correct link to the paper so that we can find it.

If you cannot find a paper you want to read you can look for papers related to Materials Genome Initative, The Materials Project, Harvard Clean Energy Project, The Open Quantum Materials Database, or references from Part 1.
If you still can't find a paper, talk to us on Slack or come to office hours
If you still can't find a paper, I am out of suggestions
